Q1.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug was introduced?
A. Using diff between two versions of a file showed me the new changes in file from the old one. While checking the changes I could see the error in the changes made newly.

Q2.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Q3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A. 	Pros: commiting manually lets user to choose when to commit , automatically saving helps when user forgets to commit changes for a long time but
			it doesn't know when to commit, so it does on basis of the time.
	cons: Doing it manually may cause problems like forgetting to commit for a long time.


Q4.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A. Because in git the files will be in repository . So the changes to a file will be same to every other file in repository.Google docs doesn't have same
	structure as git like repository.

Q5.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A. Git log- is used to see the entire history of the files.
	git diff- is used to see the difference between two files.

Q6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
A. I am confident that using version control I can try to implement new features and get back to the old version if the new one is not working.

A. I want to use git in my projects.
