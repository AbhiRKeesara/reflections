Q1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. when I initialize a repository it makes the files/ directory a git repository. We need to
	do that to make it as a repository in turn that makes tracking of files/folders by git.

Q2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you 		think it offers?
A. staging area is the level at which we keep our files that are about to committed to the repository.
	Since we commit the files once per logical change, we keep that files in the staging area.
