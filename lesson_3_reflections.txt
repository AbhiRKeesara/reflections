Q1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. I would use remote repository when I am working along with other people on the same project/feature, so that every thing can be in sync.

Q2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 		up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. I am working on a new feature for a app , If git automatically makes a pull request then before
	I complete and test my new feature my repository will have multiple commits in the repository which are incomplete that is unacceptable. So when I am done with my work I will manually do the
	pull request so that every file is up-to-data with my remote repository.

Q3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A. fork- copying the entire repository in to your github profile. Used when I don't have permission
	to change the original repository.
	clone- copying the entire repository on to your personal computer. Used to work locally and push changes to your personal repository.
	branch- used when working on a experimental feature or work. You get the entire work from master in your seperate branch and start working on it.

Q4.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A.  If I am about to go without Internet access for a while, for example to work
    on a plane, I can update my local copy before I leave.  I can do this even
    if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own branches yet.  Then if I
    want, I can perform the merge while offline, or I need to know what the
    remote version is at some point, I have an easy way to access it.
